# DiskHand

A series of specialized disk utilities for managing virtual and real disks and drives.

## About The Project üí°

DiskHand is a comprehensive set of command-line tools and scripts designed for advanced disk management. Leveraging the performance of C++ for low-level disk operations and the scripting power of Python for user interfaces and automation, this project provides powerful utilities for tasks that go beyond standard operating system tools. Whether you need to recover data, manage partitions, or create bit-for-bit disk clones, DiskHand aims to be your go-to solution.

## Features ‚ú®

    Partition Management: Easily create, resize, format, and delete partitions on both physical and virtual drives.
    Disk Imaging & Cloning: Create precise, sector-by-sector copies of disks for backup, migration, or forensic analysis.
    File System Tools: Analyze and repair various file systems including NTFS, ext4, and FAT32.
    Data Recovery: Tools to search for and recover deleted files and lost partitions.
    Cross-Platform Support: Designed to work on various operating systems.

## Technologies Used üíª 

    Python: Used for high-level scripting, command-line interfaces, and orchestrating complex workflows. Python's rich ecosystem of libraries makes it ideal for building a user-friendly layer on top of the C++ core.
    C++: Utilized for performance-critical, low-level disk access and manipulation. This ensures that operations like disk imaging and data recovery are as fast and efficient as possible.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    
    A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
    
    make (or a similar build tool)

## Installation

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/DiskHand.git
    cd DiskHand

    Install Python dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Build the C++ utilities:

    make

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è 

Each utility is designed to be run from the command line. You can find detailed instructions for each tool in its respective subdirectory.

For example, to run a hypothetical disk imaging tool:

### To get help on a specific utility
python disk_imaging/image_tool.py --help

### To create an image of a disk
python disk_imaging/image_tool.py --source /dev/sda --output /path/to/my-disk-image.img
